![20250820202750](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiaaming/blogImage/main/pic/20250820202750.png)
A lightweight Chrome extension that **paginates ChatGPT conversations** and displays them in a floating panel for easier browsing, searching, and reading.

## âœ¨ Core Features

* **Floating Dock & Panel**
  A small dock button toggles a resizable, draggable panel that sits on top of ChatGPT.

* **Automatic Q\&A Pairing**
  Detects messages from *user* and *assistant*, and groups them into clear Qâ†’A pairs.

* **Pagination**
  Splits long conversations into pages of manageable size (default: 10 pairs per page).

* **Search & Sort**
  Quickly filter questions with a search box and toggle between newest/oldest ordering.

* **Detail View**
  Click a question to open the full Q\&A with clean Markdown rendering (bold, italic, code blocks, inline code).

* **Dark/Light Mode Friendly**
  Adapts to your system theme for comfortable reading.

* **Local Only**
  No network requests or external APIs â€” all parsing and rendering happens in the browser.


## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

Long ChatGPT conversations can quickly become **hard to navigate** â€” endless scrolling, losing track of which question led to which answer.
This extension was created to **make large chats more usable**, especially when revisiting old threads for study or reference. The goal is not feature overload, but a **focused tool**: clean UI, efficient navigation, and zero reliance on external services.
